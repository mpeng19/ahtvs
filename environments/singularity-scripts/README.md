Here are the backup public singularity recipes for repositories:
* `verysure/rdkit-django`
* `verysure/postgres-alpine`
* `verysure/miniconda3-rdkit-dftb`

If you would like to maintain the singularity recipe repository, send an email to "ttttonywu [at] gmail [dot] com" 
to gain administrative access of the github repository. Execute `backup.sh` to pull the latest recipes.
If you have created more singularity recipes, add them to the list and the `backup.sh` arrays.
